Based on the resistance value of LDR sensor (Light Dependent Resistor), an LED is controlled.
If light intensity increases, resistance increases, current decreases.
Thus, if resistance value falls below certain range, then LED is turned on, to mirror the action of street lamp turning on during sunset.
Go ahead and go through the reference videos for more explaination. Your welcome:)
